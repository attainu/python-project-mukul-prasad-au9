## DESCRIPTION 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin price is a fickle thing. You never really know where it’s going to be at the end of the day. So, instead of constantly checking various sites for the latest updates, let’s make a Python program to do the work for you.

we used coinmarketcap to get hand on our latest bitcoin price

We used popular applet site IFTTT

for creating different applets

example-telegram,sms,gmail or email

and we also used gmail api to read our email so that it can change threshold value by mail only, without touching the program

and we also added whatsapp api to get notified on whatsapp

also added emergency function to get notified when price is below threhold

u can also select multiple currency for your bitcoin price
